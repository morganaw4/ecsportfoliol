	  <p> My name is Morgan Ann Wright, and I am a senior at Skyline High School who will graduate in early January. I was born and raised in Utah, and I enjoy nature and being outside, as well as skiing, fashion, and music. I've been working at  Buffalo Wild Wings for about a year and a half and was recently promoted to top hostess.</p>
