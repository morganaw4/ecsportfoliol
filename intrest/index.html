	<p>Abstract art is art that does not attempt to represent an accurate depiction of a visual reality but instead achieves its effect through the use of shapes, colors, forms, and gestural marks. Marks exist independently, but they are linked by an energy, movement, or feeling. Abstract art has been around for over a century. It can be whatever you want. There are rules and there are no rules. People can use abstract to explore things they see in their heads rather than their eyes. Abstract art allows you to be creative and express yourself.</p>

	  <p>Cubism was a revolutionary new approach to representing reality developed by artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque around 1907-08. They combined different perspectives on subjects in the same painting, resulting in paintings that appear fragmented and abstracted. The cubists wanted to show the entire structure of objects in their paintings without using realistic techniques like perspective or graded shading. They wanted to show things as they really are, not just how they appear. the visible world's forms into fragments drawn from multiple points of view, then constructing an image from them with its own internal logic.</p>

	   <p>Graffiti art is the term used to describe images or text that are spray painted onto buildings. The contemporary graffiti style has been heavily influenced by hip hop culture and the myriad international styles derived from Philadelphia and New York City Subway graffiti, but there are many other notable twentieth-century graffiti traditions. Graffiti is essential for artists to express their identity and frustrations while also honoring and preserving their culture and history. Graffiti is a type of public art that is much more than spray-painted profanity and symbols. Graffiti, when done correctly, adds a creative atmosphere to cities and towns. Graffiti can be considered beautiful in the same way that a butterfly mural is.</p>
 <h1 align="center">Fauvism Art</h1>
	  
	<p>Fauvism is an art movement that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century. The Fauvist style, distinguished by its bold colors, textured brushwork, and non-naturalistic depictions, was a seminal moment in the early twentieth century. One of the most significant contributions of Fauvism to modern art was its radical goal of detaching color from its descriptive, representational function and allowing it to exist on the canvas as an independent element. Fauvism was known for its use of bold, vibrant, almost acidic colors in unusual juxtapositions, as well as an intuitive, highly gestural approach to painting. Fauvist artists were experimenting with how color could be liberated from subject matter.</p>
	 <h1 align="center">Realism Art</h1>
	  
	    <p> Realism refers to a mid-nineteenth-century artistic movement characterized by subjects painted from everyday life in a naturalistic manner; however, the term is also commonly used to describe artworks painted in a realistic, almost photographic manner. The central concept of Realism in art is to accurately and truthfully represent the world through painting or other media. Realism art frequently deals with poor and working-class lives in order to depict the truth of the world through the depiction of reality. It refers to things or events that exist in the world on their own. It opposes the fictitious or imaginary thing or event.</p>
	  <h1 align="center">Surrealism Art</h1>
	  
	   <p>Surrealism seeks to transform human experience. It strikes a balance between a rational view of life and one that acknowledges the power of the unconscious and dreams. The artists of the movement find magic and strange beauty in the unexpected and uncanny, the overlooked and the unconventional. Surrealist artwork is distinguished by the use of fantasy, a metaphysical atmosphere, and dreamlike imagery depicting mysterious environments and landscapes, among other things. Collage, doodling, frottage, and other surrealist techniques are used. The Surrealists were heavily influenced by Sigmund Freud's theories on dreams and the workings of the subconscious mind.</p>
	  <h1 align="center">Impressionism Art</h1>
	  
	   <p>Impressionism emerged in the nineteenth century in France and is based on the practice of painting outside and spontaneously 'on the spot' rather than in a studio from sketches. Landscapes and scenes from everyday life were popular impressionist subjects. Impressionists rejected classical subjects in favor of modernity, wishing to create works that reflected their surroundings. They were united by a focus on how light could define a moment in time, with color providing definition rather than black lines. It demonstrates that art does not have to be held to the same standards as previous works.</p>
