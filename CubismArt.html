    <h1>Cubism</h1>
  
    <p>Cubism was a revolutionary new approach to representing reality developed by artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque around 1907-08.
      They combined different perspectives on subjects in the same painting, resulting in paintings that appear fragmented and abstracted.
      The cubists wanted to show the entire structure of objects in their paintings without using realistic techniques like perspective or graded shading. 
      They wanted to show things as they really are, not just how they appear. the visible world's forms into fragments drawn from multiple points 
      of view, then constructing an image from them with its own internal logic.</p>
